Python-
<br><br>

1)print(" "," ")-adds two statements<br>
2)no semicolons used<br>
3)name="shiv" use of inverted commas is necessary<br>
4)type(name) gives datatype of name<br>
5)division of two ints always gives a floating value<br>
6)a**b=a^b<br>
7)not keyword is used for negation<br>
8)by default input is taken as string. So you need to use type casting to convert string to other dt<br>
9)str[1:4]-gives letters from char at 1 to 3<br>
10)negative indexing is possible with last letter given -1 and then value decreases as we move from right to left<br>
11)if():<br>
        print()<br>
   print()  - above print is in if statement because tab space is left whereas second print is out of the if statement<br>
12)list-equivalent to arrays but can store variables of different datatypes<br>
   list functions-a.sort();a.sort(reverse=True)[for descending order];a.reverse; a.append("")[to add elements at the end];a.insert(index,element)[to add element at any index;a.remove("")[to remove element when it occurs for the first time;<br>
13)tuple~list~arrays ;tuple- tup=(1,2,3)<br>
14)Dictionaries (dict)-kind of array of variables with their values<br>
 info={"name":"shiv",12:24,"list":["shivbhai",23]}   -ex of dict<br>
values in dict can be manipulated, accessed as info["name"]="patil"<br>
15)dict methods-a.keys();a.values();a.items()[gives key value pair in form of tuples];<br>
16)sets-syntax-a={1,2,3,4,"hi"}-set stores each value once even if it is repeated<br>
elements of set are immutable hence list and dict cant be included in sets<br>
set methods-set.add(ele);set.remove(ele);set.clear();set.pop()[gives any random value];set1.union(set2);set1.intersection(set2);<br>
17)while condition:<br>

18)for loop is different in python- <br>
list_name=[1,2,3,4,5]<br>
for i in list_name:<br>
print[i]-basically for  loop is used to access elements of list, dictionaries, tuples ,strings one by one in the form of "i"<br>
--->pass keyword is used to not do any work in for loop<br>
19)functions-<br>
  def fn_name(p1,p2...):<br>
return value<br>

20)file i\o- f=open ("filename.txt","r")[r=read]<br>
line1=f.read()<br>
line2=f.readline()<br>
print(line1)--->complete data in the file is displayed<br>
print(line2)----->one line is read only <br>
-------->>>>reading a file can be thought as a cursor moving from one point in the file to next continuously so you cant read the same data multiple times with opening of the file once only<br>
21) @staticmethod is use dto make the function available at class level and not at the object level<br>
ex-@staticmethod<br>
   def welcome() [no requirement of using self in argument]<br>
print("welcome guys")<br>
22)del student.name or del student will delete the object attribute or object<br>
23) __name makes the attribute private whereas by default it is public<br>
24)Inheritance- class child(parent):<br>
[this means that the child class will have access to all the attributes and methods of class parent]<br>


25)Numpy- To install use- 'pip install numpy'<br>
     then to use numpy- import numpy as variable_name<br>
i) a @ b gives matrix multiplication of two matrices a and b<br>
ii)sorting in 2d array- variable_name.sort(x)-sorts individual rows; to sort column wise-v_n.sort(x,axis=0)<br>


26)json converts dictionary-->string-->dictionary <br>
   the converted string can even be used by other languages who use json such as c++,so json plays role of joining to languages<br>
json.dumps(books) converts dict books to string and json.loads(books) converts back to dict<br>
27)__name__ has predefined valieof __main__. This value changes if one file is being called from other and the value is now changed to the name of the file.<br>
If file is direclty opened and not called from other program file then the value remains as __main__.<br>

28)exception- to not stop the program from running even after the exception such as / by 0 occur- use-> try  part_of_code_where_you_think_exception_can_occur except exception as e   rest_of_the_code.<br>

29)commands in pandas-<br>
df=pd.read_csv(addressoftable)<br>
df.shape<br>
rows,colums=df.shape    rows-gives no. of rows<br>
df.head(n)-gives first n rows<br>
df.describe()-gives the statistcs of the datatable   <br>
